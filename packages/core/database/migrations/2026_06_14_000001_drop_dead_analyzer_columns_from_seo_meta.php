/**
 * Core 3.0 contract reset: drop the dead content-analyzer columns from
 * seo_meta.
 *
 * The v2 create_seo_meta_table migration shipped six columns and two indexes
 * for a content-analyzer subsystem that never shipped — nothing in the
 * released core or Pro ever wrote a value to them. Core 3 sheds them: the
 * numerical SEO score becomes a Pro-owned scan-result field (with its own
 * stored rubric_version), and core keeps only the metadata contract.
 *
 * The published create migration is immutable, so this is a separate cleanup
 * migration. It runs on both paths:
 * - Fresh install: create_seo_meta_table builds the columns, then this drops
 *   them, netting the correct v3 schema.
 * - Upgrade from a released v2 install: this drops the columns in place.
 *
 * `focus_keywords` is KEPT — it is core-owned and read by the Pro scanner.
 *
 * Idempotent and safe on partially-migrated schemas: every index and column
 * is checked for existence before being dropped, so re-running, or running
 * against a schema where some of these were already removed by hand, is a
 * no-op rather than an error.
 *
 * IRREVERSIBLE: down() is intentionally a no-op. These columns only ever held
 * NULLs in shipped installs, so there is nothing to restore; re-creating empty
 * columns would only resurrect the dead schema this migration exists to remove.
 *
